This is the note I received from my friend. Now, commercial companies require a similar approach for their own organisation. For example, HR-related processes should be clearly trained. The same is true with the rest of a firm's policies. But they would not like to disclose or share this information with players like Anthropic or OpenAI. 
Now have a VERY look at the proposal below and let me know how exactly we can improvise this further and make it generic (explore for a better platform both for LLaMA 3 70B and n8n & expand this for the top use cases Needed for a typical mid-size and large companies in the commercial world) so that a customer should be in a position to specify what exactly they would like to use and train their platform for. For example, if they would like to use HR policies or whether it is for customer support for technical information queries or it is for finance-related documents training so that all the employees within the company should be in a position to explore the finance-related questions. The advantages are listed below. Think in terms of expanding this concept further for other large and mid-sized organisations who would like to keep privacy and lack of data exposure to other companies as a primary concern and would like to host these services within the premise. Also suggest the top 10 use cases which are going to be useful for the mid-size and large companies in the commercial world who are very nosy for their Secrecy and confidentiality of the data. 
Lastly, also compare on-premise or cloud-based deployment scenarios as well so that I can propose the client accordingly. 
================
Deal with a mid-sized law firm-  to build and deploy a fully private AI setup using LLaMA 3 70B completely self-hosted, no third-party APIs, and compliant with strict legal data policies and we’re using n8n to connect the entire thing.

This will be a full blown internal system. Pretty much their own GPT4-tier legal analyst, trained to process internal case law, filings, and contracts, answer complex questions, and summarize docs but with zero exposure to OpenAI or Anthropic.

They needed control, privacy and automation.

Tech stack We’ll be using:

LLaMA 3 70B (quantized + accelerated using vLLM)

Hosted privately on CoreWeave using dual A100 GPUs.

ChromaDB as the vector store to handle document embedding and retrieval

LlamaIndex to power a RAG pipeline, enabling real-time Q&A over their case files

n8n as the glue to automate everything from doc uploads to Slack/email notifications

A simple but clean Streamlit-based web UI for their staff to chat with the model, ask questions, and get summaries instantly

All of it wrapped in a secure setup with JWT auth, IP access controls, and full audit logging

How n8n will make this 10x easier

We won’t write a traditional backend for this. Instead, we’ll use n8n, which gives us/them the flexibility to:

Monitor a shared Google Drive folder for new legal documents

Automatically convert, chunk, and embed those docs into ChromaDB

Kick off a summary job with the LLM and route results to the right paralegal via Slack or email

Handle incoming staff questions (via form or chat UI) and respond with real-time LLM-generated answers

Log everything for compliance, reporting, and later audit

The firm’s paralegals will be able to drop in new documents and have summaries + search access within minutes, without ever calling IT or opening a support ticket.

And they can also edit or extend the workflows in n8n themselves.
Once deployed they’ll pay ~$1,200/month in GPU hosting and have an in-house, private legal AI engine that’s fully theirs.

From the law firm’s perspective, this is an easy investment that’ll pay itself back in one quarter.

And few things I noticed on this deal

Privacy and control are the new killer features.

Many businesses can’t upload their documents to OpenAI/chatgpt due to privacy and they love the concept of a private llm and more firms are realizing they want AI power without giving up data sovereignty.

LLaMA 3 70B is production-ready when deployed properly — especially for professional use cases like law.

Clients don’t want to build all this themselves. They want someone to make it work and keep it simple.

n8n is criminally underrated for LLM-based workflow automation. It makes this entire project modular, flexible, and fast.
