Below is a side-by-side comparison of how our “cookbook” approach applies to three scenarios—Law Firm, Healthcare, and Internal HR Policies—mapped against the same phases and components. The final column explains each aspect in super-simple, real-life terms for a non-technical 15-year-old.

Aspect	Law Firm	Healthcare	Internal HR Policies	15-Year-Old Explanation (Analogy)
Domain & Objective	Build a private legal analyst: ingest case law, filings, contracts; answer Qs; summarize docs.	Build a private clinical assistant: ingest medical records, research papers; answer clinical Qs; summarize patient notes.	Build a private HR assistant: ingest company handbooks, policies; answer employee Qs; summarize benefits and procedures.	Choosing a “theme” for your helper—like deciding if you’re cooking Italian (law), French (healthcare), or Mexican (HR) dishes.
Key Fields (Spec Inputs)	domain=legal
data_sources=[“case_law_DB”,“contracts_drive”]
throughput=100
compliance_flags=[“privilege_law”]	domain=healthcare
data_sources=[“EHR_api”,“research_PDFs”]
throughput=50
compliance_flags=[“HIPAA”]	domain=hr
data_sources=[“hr_handbooks”,“payroll_CSV”]
throughput=200
compliance_flags=[“GDPR”]	Recipe ingredients—you tell the app: “We’re in legal, we need contracts and court cases; we serve 100 users; must follow privilege rules,” just like saying “I need flour, sugar, and eggs.”
Phase I Prompt (SpecBuilder)	Asks one-by-one:
“Which legal docs? Why?”
Clarifies privilege concerns.	Asks:
“Which patient data sources? Any PHI fields?”
Clarifies HIPAA needs.	Asks:
“Which HR policies? Any personal data?”
Clarifies GDPR rules.	Friendly quiz—the helper asks simple questions: “Do you need pizza or pasta?” Here: “Do you need patient records or lab reports?”
Phase II.1 (SolutionDesigner)	Generates YAML services:
- Legal-LLM-API
- ChromaDB-legal
- n8n-legal-flows	Generates YAML services:
- Clinical-LLM-API
- ChromaDB-health
- n8n-health-flows	Generates YAML services:
- HR-LLM-API
- ChromaDB-hr
- n8n-hr-flows	Kitchen layout plan—where you put the oven, table, and fridge.
Phase II.2 (IaCGenerator)	Terraform code (main.tf, variables.tf):
- Dual A100 GPU nodes on CoreWeave
- Private network
- ChromaDB container
- vLLM service	Terraform code:
- GPU nodes for model inference
- VPC in private cloud region
- ChromaDB container with encrypted volumes	Terraform code:
- Standard CPU nodes
- VPC or on-prem servers
- ChromaDB container
- Smaller model footprint	Shopping list + instructions—“Buy two big ovens, one fridge, and set timers.”
Phase II.3 (WorkflowBuilder)	n8n flow JSON:
1. Watch “Case Files” folder
2. PDF parser → embed to ChromaDB
3. Summarize via LLM → Slack to paralegal	n8n flow JSON:
1. Monitor “EHR uploads”
2. OCR & chunk patient notes → embed
3. Summarize / extract vitals → notify care team	n8n flow JSON:
1. Watch “HR uploads” folder
2. Parse PDFs/CSVs → embed
3. Answer policy Qs → email/Slack to employees	Robot chef steps—“Grab dough, flatten, bake, slide onto plate.”
Phase II.4 (CICDArchitect)	GitHub Actions:
- Lint Terraform
- Terraform plan/apply on approval
- Smoke test /health	Same pipeline, plus:
- HIPAA compliance scan
- Data deletion test	Same pipeline, plus:
- GDPR data deletion workflow test	Quality check—“Taste one cookie before you bake 50 more.”
Local Sandbox (Docker Compose)	Services: FastAPI, React UI, n8n, ChromaDB, Supabase PG + RLS, GPT-stub	Same, with GPT-stub and dummy EHR data	Same, with dummy HR CSVs and handbook files	Play kitchen—a toy oven and pretend ingredients to practice before the real bake.
Phase III Observability	Metrics: token usage, latency, audit logs of every prompt/Q&A, RAG hit ratio	Metrics: same + PHI access logs, embedding drift alerts	Metrics: same + PII access logs, policy update drift	Oven thermometer + timer—you watch temperature and time so cookies don’t burn.
Security & Compliance	RLS enforced, JWT auth, IP allow lists, audit logs, tfsec scans, privilege law flags	RLS, JWT, VPC isolation, PHI encryption, audit retention, HIPAA/GDPR flags, tfsec scans	RLS, JWT, VPC, PII encryption, GDPR flags, audit retention, tfsec scans	Safety checks—“Wear oven mitts, keep a fire extinguisher.”
Estimated Cost	~$1,200/mo GPU hosting + infra overhead	Higher GPU cost + compliance audit cost	Lower GPU cost (smaller model) + standard infra cost	Budgeting—“$20 for ingredients”
End Result	A private “GPT-4-tier” legal analyst that paralegals can use without IT help	A private clinical assistant for doctors/nurses to query records and literature	A private HR bot for employees to ask about benefits, policies, paid time off	Freshly baked cookies—delicious, hot, and exactly how you planned them.
Top 10 Enterprise Use Cases
Use Case	Description & Privacy Focus
Legal – Case/Contract Analysis	Summarize contracts, precedents, filings; answer complex case-law queries. Maintains confidentiality of client/case data; on-prem ensures compliance with privilege laws.
Finance – Reports & Auditing	Interpret earnings reports, audit logs, compliance rules. Provides decision support to CFO teams. Keeps sensitive financial data in-house to meet regulatory requirements.
HR – Policy & Employee Q&A	Internal HR assistant: answers benefits/policy questions, onboards staff with summarized manuals. Secures personal employee data and sensitive HR records on-site.
Customer Support – Private KB	AI-powered knowledge base using company’s internal docs. Responds to support tickets using private data (product manuals, previous tickets). No customer info leaks.
R&D/Engineering – Technical Docs	Search and summarize patents, design docs, and technical specs. Protects IP by hosting all R&D knowledge internally (no SaaS cloud indexing).
Compliance/Audit	Automatically checks new regulations, summarizes changes, assists audit teams. Ensures proprietary procedures and audit trails remain private and auditable.
Marketing – Insights & Content	Analyzes proprietary market research, creative briefs, and brand guidelines. Generates summaries/ideas without exposing confidential marketing strategies externally.
Operations – Logs & Maintenance	Parses maintenance manuals, sensor logs, and SOPs for troubleshooting. Keeps operational data (e.g. equipment logs) secure within the enterprise network.
Sales – CRM & Proposals	Summarizes sales calls, drafts proposals, retrieves client histories from CRM. Protects customer data and internal forecasts by processing on-premises.
Healthcare/Pharma (if applicable)	(If in scope) Summarizes clinical notes, trial data, medical literature. Note: Strict HIPAA/Regulatory compliance; fully private deployment is essential in healthcare.
