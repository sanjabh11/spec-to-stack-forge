# Implementation Plan for AI Consultant Platform

This plan details each step to build a turnkey, no-code AI consultant web app for enterprise automation, using private LLMs and RAG. It is intended for engineers, product managers, and executives. Citations support key choices and best practices

## 1. Deploy LLaMA 3 70B via vLLM on CoreWeave

1. **Obtain the model:** Acquire the LLaMA 3 70B model weights (instruct variant) from Meta’s release (e.g. via Hugging Face). Ensure compliance with Meta’s licensing.
2. **Set up GPUs:** Use a high-performance GPU cloud (e.g. [CoreWeave](https://www.coreweave.com/)) to host the model. CoreWeave provides Kubernetes-native GPU instances (NVIDIA A100/H100, etc.), which can spin up bare-metal resources in \~5 seconds. This rapid provisioning and support for the latest GPUs makes it well-suited for LLM inference.
3. **Install vLLM:** On the GPU servers, install [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai) (v0.6.5 or later). vLLM is an open-source inference engine optimized for large models. It natively supports LLaMA-family models (including LLaMA 3 70B) for text generation tasks. For example, vLLM’s “Supported Models” list includes `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct` under its LLaMA architecture.
4. **Optimize loading:** Use CoreWeave’s [Tensorizer](https://docs.coreweave.com) integration to serialize the model to disk. vLLM can load tensorized models directly onto the GPU, significantly reducing startup time and CPU memory usage. This also supports GPU-side encryption of model weights. (Note: install `vllm[tensorizer]` to enable this feature.)
5. **Configure inference:** Configure vLLM for efficient inference. Enable model quantization (e.g. FP16 or 8-bit) to fit the 70B model on available GPUs, testing for stability. vLLM supports batching and streaming; tune `max_batch_size` and `max_tokens` for performance. If needed, use a multi-GPU setup (CoreWeave’s Kubernetes can orchestrate multi-node inference clusters).
6. **API endpoint:** Wrap vLLM in an HTTP service (it provides an OpenAI-compatible API). For example, use `vllm --engine_port 8000` to expose a completions endpoint. Ensure JWT authentication at this API layer to protect access.
7. **Monitoring:** Set up GPU monitoring (CoreWeave metrics, logs) to ensure the inference service is healthy and scalable.

**Tools:** Use NVIDIA A100/H100 GPUs (CoreWeave provides these), Python/vLLM (vLLM docs), and CoreWeave’s Kubernetes cloud (coreweave.com).

## 2. Build a RAG Pipeline for Documents

&#x20;*Figure: Typical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow – user query → embedding & search in vector store → retrieve documents → LLM answers with context. (Adapted from NVIDIA’s RAG overview.)*

Implement a document-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline so users can query corporate data. Key steps:

* **Choose a vector DB:** Select a vector database to store embeddings. Options include **ChromaDB** (current setup), [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io), or [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech). All are open-source and support enterprise use. For example, Chroma is Apache-2.0 licensed, in-memory or Docker-based, and fully-featured. Weaviate is cloud-native and supports LlamaIndex directly. Qdrant also integrates with LlamaIndex and offers GPU-accelerated search.
* **Data ingestion:** Use LlamaIndex (a Python framework) to ingest documents. Its `SimpleDirectoryReader` can load PDFs, Word docs, PowerPoints, Markdown, etc. automatically. In an n8n workflow, for example, when a new PDF is detected, pass its text to LlamaIndex. It will split long documents into smaller “nodes” (e.g. 1–2K token chunks) and attach metadata.
* **Compute embeddings:** For each chunk, generate embeddings using a pre-trained model (e.g. an open-source text-embedding model or a service like OpenAI’s embeddings). Store the embeddings along with document IDs in the chosen vector store. (LlamaIndex supports Chroma, Weaviate, Qdrant, etc. out-of-the-box.) For instance, with Qdrant you can use `QdrantVectorStore` in LlamaIndex and call `VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(...)` after uploading embeddings.
* **Query-time retrieval:** At runtime, when a user poses a query, convert the query into an embedding and perform a similarity search against the vector DB to retrieve the top-K relevant chunks. LlamaIndex automates this retrieval step. The retrieved text passages serve as contextual “knowledge” for the LLM.
* **LLM response generation:** Append the retrieved chunks (or summaries of them) to the user’s query as context in the prompt. Then send this augmented prompt to the LLM (e.g. vLLM with LLaMA 3). The LLM will generate answers grounded in the company documents. This RAG approach ensures answers reflect up-to-date internal data.
* **Example & Benefits:** As AWS explains, RAG “introduces an information retrieval component that…pull\[s] information from a new data source” so the LLM sees both the query and relevant data. NVIDIA notes RAG “empowers LLMs with real-time data access,” preserves data privacy, and “mitigates hallucinations” by grounding answers. By integrating RAG, our chatbot can cite company policies or past cases to increase accuracy.

**Tools:** [LlamaIndex](https://llamaindex.ai) (Python library for RAG), the Chroma DB engine or alternatives (Weaviate, Qdrant). See LlamaIndex docs for Weaviate/Qdrant integration. The NVIDIA and AWS references above provide guidance on RAG design.

## 3. Extend n8n Workflows for Document Ingestion & Notifications

Use n8n (open-source workflow automation) to orchestrate data ingestion and alerts:

* **Google Drive monitoring:** Add an **n8n Google Drive Trigger** node to watch shared folders. Configure it (with OAuth credentials) to fire whenever a new or updated document appears. This automates ingestion without manual uploads.
* **File processing:** In the workflow, use a **Function** or **HTTP Request** node to retrieve the file content. For PDFs, run a PDF parser (e.g. [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) or a cloud OCR) to extract text. Then chunk the text (e.g. by paragraphs or fixed token size) and send those chunks to the RAG ingestion routine above (embedding and storage).
* **Summarization (optional):** After ingesting, optionally call the LLM to generate a summary of the document. For example, invoke the vLLM endpoint with a “Summarize this document:” prompt plus extracted text. Store the summary in the database or send it to staff.
* **Notifications:** Use **Slack** and **Email** nodes in n8n to notify relevant teams. For instance, when a doc is processed or a summary is ready, n8n can post a message to a Slack channel or send an email with the key points. The Slack node can use webhooks or a Slack Bot token to post messages. The n8n Slack Trigger/Node supports reacting to events and posting content to channels. Similarly, use the n8n Email node (SMTP) for notifications.
* **Q\&A routing:** Create a webhook or UI form node for employee queries. When a question is submitted (via chat UI), n8n calls the RAG/LLM service to get an answer and returns it. All queries and answers are logged.
* **Logging:** Maintain audit logs (n8n execution logs plus your own DB entries) for compliance. Ensure every step (file ingested, LLM call, notification sent) is recorded with timestamps and user IDs. n8n’s built-in execution logs and our JWT auth logs can feed into a centralized log store (Elastic/Graylog, etc.).

**Tools & References:** n8n’s built-in [Google Drive Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrivetrigger/) node handles file events. Use Slack’s API or n8n’s Slack node (see n8n docs) for chat alerts. For PDF text extraction, common libraries (PyMuPDF, PDFMiner) suffice. ChromaDB can be updated via Python or HTTP (it supports REST APIs).

## 4. Simplify the User Interface (React or Streamlit)

Ensure the UI is extremely user-friendly for non-technical staff:

* **Clean React UI:** Simplify the existing React app to a minimal set of actions. Provide a landing page with clear instructions (e.g. “Ask a question about HR policy”). Use simple input forms or chat windows. Employ large fonts, tooltips, and example questions. Hide any technical jargon. Use form controls (dropdowns, toggles) for any advanced options (e.g. selecting a vertical or workflow template).
* **Streamlit alternative:** As a rapid prototype or alternate interface, consider a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app. Streamlit lets data teams build interactive ML apps in Python with very little code. A Streamlit front-end could provide an even simpler single-page UI: input box, a “Submit” button, and text output. It automatically handles layout, so developers can focus on prompts and results. This can be offered as a low-effort demo or even a staff-facing tool if IT prefers Python.
* **Interactive workflows:** In either UI, guide users step-by-step. For example, present one question at a time, show the generated answer, then offer a “Next question” button. Provide “Help” or example use-cases (e.g. “Try asking: ‘What is our leave policy?’”). The goal is that any employee or manager can use it without training.
* **Accessibility & branding:** Apply enterprise UI frameworks (e.g. Material UI or Atlassian’s Atlaskit) so the tool matches corporate style. Ensure mobile responsiveness if needed.

**Tools:** Use standard web frameworks: [React](https://reactjs.org) for a production UI, or [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) for quick Python-based dashboards. Both can call your backend APIs. No citations needed beyond Streamlit’s official description of being fast for data apps.

## 5. Executive Dashboards and Reporting

Provide summarized visual dashboards for senior leadership:

* **Key metrics:** Determine KPIs that executives care about (e.g. number of workflows automated, average response time, documents ingested, cost/time savings). Show these in a dashboard. For example, charts or counters for “New HR FAQs answered this month,” “Average turnaround time for summaries,” etc.
* **Workflow diagrams:** Include high-level flowcharts (e.g. the RAG pipeline or n8n flow) to illustrate how the system works. A clear diagram (like **Figure 1** above) helps non-technical leaders grasp the architecture at a glance.
* **Benefits summary:** Present bullet-point “Business Impact” stats. For instance: “Reduced document processing time by X%,” “Self-service answers without IT tickets,” “Improved data security (no third-party),” etc. (This echoes the idea that RAG “makes AI accessible” and “preserves data privacy”.)
* **Dashboard design:** Use a BI tool or charting library for polished visuals. Options include Plotly Dash, Metabase, Tableau, or even a custom React dashboard. What matters is clarity. Qlik’s guidance on executive dashboards is apt: *“An executive dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) in one location so corporate officers can make agile, data-driven decisions”*.
* **Next actions:** Include a “Recommended Next Steps” section. For example: “Expand pilot to Legal dept.”, “Review model fine-tuning options”, or “Begin ROI analysis for automation.” This guides leadership on how to proceed.

**References:** Executive dashboards should aggregate KPIs for decision-makers. We leverage NVIDIA’s RAG benefit list (real-time data, privacy, reduced hallucinations) as impact points and AWS’s note on source attribution to emphasize trust. Dashboards can include these outcomes in plain terms.

## 6. Support for Multiple LLMs and Verticals

Build the system to be extensible across models and industries:

* **Pluggable LLM framework:** Architect an abstraction layer for LLM backends. For example, use a standard interface (like OpenAI-compatible APIs or LangChain’s `LLM` classes) so new models can be added by changing configuration, not code. For open models, continue using vLLM (it also supports [Mistral models](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)). Indeed, Mistral AI recommends vLLM as a deployment engine for Mistral models. For closed-source models (e.g. Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini), integrate via their cloud APIs under the same abstract interface. This “LLM-agnostic” design ensures you can plug in Gemini, Mistral, Claude, etc. with minimal refactoring.
* **Multi-vertical design:** Support different industry domains (Legal, HR, Finance, etc.) by modularizing content and prompts. Maintain separate document collections or indexes per vertical. Provide industry-specific prompt templates or few-shot examples (e.g. legal Q\&A vs. HR policy Q\&A). In the UI, allow selecting a “vertical” so the system loads the appropriate knowledge base and guidelines. For instance, the Legal vertical might load a corpus of contracts and case law; HR loads employee handbook docs. This way the same RAG+LLM engine can serve any department.
* **Customizability:** Plan for future fine-tuning or prompt-engineering. For truly domain-specific use-cases, later one might fine-tune a private LLM on company data. The architecture should allow inserting a fine-tuned model as a drop-in replacement.
* **Frameworks:** Tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex inherently support multiple models and can switch between vector stores and LLMs by config. Use environment variables or an admin settings page to configure which model or endpoint each client/tenant uses.

**Tools:** Continue using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for self-hosted models (LLaMA, Mistral). For managed models, use the respective APIs (e.g. [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com) for Claude). The Mistral docs confirm vLLM’s suitability for on-prem Mistral deployment.

## 7. Security, Privacy and Compliance

Given sensitive enterprise data, enforce strict security and compliance:

* **Data isolation:** Host all components within the company’s cloud or data center. Use **single-tenant** instances (no shared infrastructure). For example, run the vector DB and LLM inference on a VPC or on-prem servers so that no document content ever goes to external internet. As Skyflow notes, private LLMs (self-hosted or via VPC) keep sensitive data fully in-house. The diagram from Skyflow illustrates moving both the vector DB and LLM internal so “no information…is transferred across the Internet”.
* **Network security:** Enforce TLS encryption in transit for all API calls (LLM endpoints, web UI, n8n workflows). Use a private Virtual Network and firewall rules so only authorized subnets can reach the LLM service. For CoreWeave (or any cloud), use private networking or VPN.
* **Authentication & auditing:** Use strong authentication (JWT, OAuth) for user access. Already implemented JWT auth and audit logs should record **all** actions (document ingestion, queries, administrative changes). Store logs in a secure, immutable system. Ensure logs include user IDs, timestamps, and actions, as required for compliance audits.
* **Data encryption at rest:** Encrypt document storage and vector database. ChromaDB can be configured with disk encryption. Vector stores like Qdrant/Weaviate support encrypted volumes or cloud KMS. Key material (LLM weights, DB keys) should be stored securely (e.g. in HashiCorp Vault).
* **Model governance:** Be mindful of “model poisoning” or prompt injection. Implement input validation and rate limits on queries. Keep the LLM versions updated and retrain on sanitized data. For compliance standards (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA if relevant), ensure data removal and user consent mechanisms if personal data is involved.
* **Third-party API caution:** If integrating external LLM APIs (Gemini, Claude), use only private API endpoints (e.g. Google Cloud’s VPC Service Controls) to prevent data egress. Prefer fully private models whenever possible; this aligns with guidelines that “any sensitive data will only be available within a controlled environment”.
* **Privacy-by-design:** Do not log or store the content of queries beyond what’s needed for audit. Consider anonymizing logs. Ensure that any employee queries (which may contain PII) are handled per company policy.

**References:** Private LLM architectures inherently bolster privacy because data never leaves the corporate boundary. NVIDIA similarly emphasizes that a self-hosted RAG solution “preserves data privacy” by keeping everything on-prem. Follow industry best practices (OWASP, NIST) for web app security and regularly review compliance requirements for each vertical (e.g. legal restrictions on data handling).

## 8. Extensibility Strategy

To ensure long-term versatility:

* **Modular design:** Keep each component (UI, workflows, LLM engine, vector DB) as independent services with well-defined interfaces. This allows swapping one without breaking others. For example, the React frontend calls a generic `/api/llm-completion` endpoint, so you could replace Llama with any model behind that endpoint.
* **Configuration-driven:** Use config files or an admin UI to enable/disable modules. To support a new vertical, an admin should be able to upload a new document corpus or set up a new n8n workflow without code changes.
* **Scalability:** Architect for scale-out. Use container orchestration (Kubernetes on CoreWeave) to scale the LLM and workflow services per tenant. For multi-model support, containerize each model server (e.g. one pod for LLaMA3, one for Mistral), and route requests based on user selection.
* **Documentation & templates:** Provide templates for common verticals. E.g. an HR template that includes a sample HR policy corpus and pre-written prompts, a legal template for contracts. This jump-starts adoption in new departments.
* **Maintenance:** Regularly update model versions and dependencies. Because the backend is LLM-agnostic, swapping in a new model should be straightforward. For example, adding a new Claude model might just involve updating an API key and endpoint in config.

By following these steps, the engineering team can build a robust, secure AI workflow platform that any department can customize. Senior leaders get clear dashboards and ROI summaries, while staff get a friendly no-code interface. The system stays extendable and compliant as it grows.
