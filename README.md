## Step-by-Step Usage Guide

1. **Access the Platform**
   - Visit the main dashboard at `/` for quick actions and navigation.

2. **Estimate Costs**
   - Click the **Cost Estimator** card or go to `/cost-estimator`.
   - Adjust parameters (data volume, users, model, GPU, etc.) to get real-time, line-item cost breakdowns.

3. **Build a Platform**
   - Click the **Platform Builder** card or go to `/platform-builder`.
   - Complete the **Requirement Wizard** (domain, requirements, compliance, etc.).
   - Review the cost estimate (step 5) and finalize your specification.
   - Generate architecture, infrastructure, and workflow artifacts.
   - Deploy using the integrated DevOps dashboard.

4. **Manage Knowledge Base**
   - Use the **Knowledge Base** card to upload and manage documents for RAG.
   - In the **Chatbot**, switch to "Knowledge Base Q&A" mode to ask questions grounded in your uploaded documents. The system retrieves relevant chunks and generates an answer using the LLM.

5. **Monitor and Analyze**
   - Use the **Analytics** card for observability and performance metrics.
   - Access the **Executive Dashboard** (via `/admin`) for KPIs, ROI, and strategic recommendations.

6. **Admin & Configuration**
   - Go to `/admin` for model/vector DB management, workflow library, and advanced settings.

7. **Install and Preview Workflows**
   - Use the **Workflow Library** tab in Admin to browse, preview, and install n8n workflow templates for various verticals.

8. **Scenario Planning**
   - Use the Cost Estimator and Platform Builder for scenario planning and executive decision support.

## Production Deployment & Feature Validation

**The UI remains user-friendly and unchanged for non-technical users. The following steps are for technical users/admins to validate and operate the new infrastructure features:**

### 1. **Deploy LLaMA 3 70B and Mistral 7B on CoreWeave**
- See `README-deployment.md` for full details.
- Set your Hugging Face token:
  ```bash
  export HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN="your_token_here"
  ```
- Deploy all models:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deploy-all-models.sh
  ```
- Monitor deployment:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/gpu-monitor.sh
  kubectl get pods -n ai-models
  ```
- Scale up/down as needed:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/scale-model.sh up   # or down
  ```

### 2. **Validate Model Endpoints**
- Test LLaMA 3 70B:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://llama3-70b-service:8000/v1/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct", "prompt": "Hello", "max_tokens": 50}'
  ```
- Test Mistral 7B:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://mistral-service:8000/v1/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"model": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2", "prompt": "Hello", "max_tokens": 50}'
  ```

### 3. **Check Multi-Model Abstraction**
- In the Admin UI (`/admin`), use the Model Config tab to switch between LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemini.
- The backend (`ModelManager`, `LLM Gateway`) will route requests to the selected model.
- All model usage and costs are tracked.

### 4. **Validate RAG and Vector Store Integrations**
- In the Admin UI or via API, configure and test ChromaDB, Weaviate, and Qdrant.
- Use the VectorSearch component to run semantic search across real vector stores.
- Ingest documents and verify chunking, embedding, and retrieval.
- Test via API:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://your-app/api/rag/search \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"query": "test query", "store": "chromadb-default"}'
  ```

### 5. **Monitor and Optimize**
- Use `./scripts/gpu-monitor.sh` for GPU and model health.
- Use the Executive Dashboard in the UI for KPIs and business metrics.
- Use scaling scripts and resource quotas to optimize costs.

### 6. **Scenario: End-to-End Validation**
- Build a platform in the UI, select a model and vector store, ingest documents, and run a search.
- Confirm that:
  - The correct model is used (check logs or Admin UI)
  - The correct vector store is queried
  - Results are returned and displayed in the UI
